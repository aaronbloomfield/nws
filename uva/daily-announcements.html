  - Regrades are going to take some time; don't hold your breath on those...
- Readings:
  - None assigned currently
- About the final exam: there will not be an *in-person **AND** required* final exam
  - Legalese: There may still be a final, but it will either be online, optional, a make-up, etc.
  - I'm not sure how I want to handle this yet, but the grading percentages will have to change
