Linux Tutorial
==============

[Go up to the NWS HW page](../index.html) ([md](../index.md))

### Overview

This assignment is a tutorial for how to use Linux.  It introduces the basic commands that you will need to know to navigate in a Linux environment.  This assignment does not go over Docker commands, which are instead presented in the [Docker configuration assignment](../docker/index.html) ([md](../docker/index.md)).

If you already know Linux, then you can just browse through this assignment to ensure that you are familiar with all the material presented.

The idea is that this assignment can be used as a reference for when you are using Linux.

You will be submitting an edited version of the [linux.py](linux.py.html) ([src](linux.py)) file.

This assignment has very little in terms of the deliverable -- in fact, you could easily skip to the 'Submission' section, make up answers, and get full credit on this assignment.  **HOWEVER,** this assignment is going to be necessary to complete before doing *any other* assignment in this course, as pretty  much *all* the assignments will be using this docker setup.


### Changelog

Any changes to this page will be put here for easy reference.  Typo fixes and minor clarifications are not listed here.  So far there aren't any significant changes to report.


### Tutorial

The tutorial we recommend is [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/linux-command-line-tutorial/).  However, only the second half of the sections are relevant:

- [Linux commands to run in the terminal](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/linux-command-line-tutorial/#basic-linux-commands-to-run-in-the-terminal)
- [How to work with directories in Linux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/linux-command-line-tutorial/#how-to-work-with-directories-in-linux)
- [Commands to work with files in Linux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/linux-command-line-tutorial/#commands-to-work-with-files-in-linux)
- [Commands to work with file contents](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/linux-command-line-tutorial/#commands-to-work-with-file-contents)
- [Linux command operations](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/linux-command-line-tutorial/#linux-command-operations)

As you learn the commands, you should try them out in the Docker containers.  How to start the containers, and then connect to them, is described in the [Docker configuration assignment](../docker/index.html) ([md](../docker/index.md)).


### Submission

You will be submitting an edited version of the [linux.py](linux.py.html) ([src](linux.py)) file.  The comments therein explain what values you should fill in.  We are interested in honest answers, not [sycophantic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sycophantic) answers.  The assignment is auto-graded, so you will get full credit as long as you fill in the values in that file correctly.

That file is the only file you should submit to Gradescope.
