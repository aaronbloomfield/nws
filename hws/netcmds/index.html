<div id='toverview' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='overview'>Overview</h3>
<p>This assignment is a tutorial about various network commands on a Linux system. It is different than the <a href='../linux/index.html'>Linux tutorial</a> (<a href='../linux/index.md'>md</a>) assignment – that assignment went over the basics of how to use Linux, whereas this tutorial goes over how to use commands that are specific to interacting with the network. This assignment does not go over Docker commands, which are instead presented in the <a href='../docker/index.html'>Docker configuration assignment</a> (<a href='../docker/index.md'>md</a>).</p>
<p>The idea is that this assignment can be used as a reference for when you need to use these network commands.</p>
<p>You will be submitting an edited version of the <a href='netcmds.py.html'>netcmds.py</a> (<a href='netcmds.py'>src</a>) file.</p>
<p>This assignment has very little in terms of the deliverable – in fact, you could easily skip to the ‘Submission’ section, make up answers, and get full credit on this assignment. <strong>HOWEVER,</strong> this assignment is going to be necessary to complete before doing <em>any other</em> assignment in this course. The material gone over in this tutorial are also fair game for pop quizzes and exams.</p>
<p>There are multiple sections (tabs), and each one goes over how to use a given command (or two). Some of them reference external pages.</p>
<p>As you learn the commands, you should try them out in the Docker containers. How to start the containers, and then connect to them, is described in the <a href='../docker/index.html'>Docker configuration assignment</a> (<a href='../docker/index.md'>md</a>).</p>
<p>For all the commands below, there is a manual page. Normally, you could run <code>man &lt;cmd&gt;</code> (example: <code>man ssh</code>) to see the full set of options available for that command. However, the manual pages are not included in the Docker images to conserve space. You can instead do a web search for <code>man dig</code>, and the manual page will likely be the first entry that appears.</p>
<p>All of these commands are available for all operating systems. However, many may not be installed on your host system. They are all installed on the course Docker setup.</p>
</div><div id='tchangelog' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='changelog'>Changelog</h3>
<p>Any changes to this page will be put here for easy reference. Typo fixes and minor clarifications are not listed here. So far there aren’t any significant changes to report.</p>
</div><div id='tssh-and-telnet' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='ssh-and-telnet'>ssh and telnet</h3>
<p>ssh, for Secure Shell, is a way to connect to another host. telnet is the same idea as ssh, but does not use encryption of any sort. ssh uses TLS encryption for the entire session.</p>
<h4 id='basic-ssh'>Basic ssh</h4>
<p>To connect to a different host, you can use the <code>ssh</code> command. Note that to connect to a container for the first time, we use <code>docker exec</code>. But once within the containers, we can use <code>ssh</code> to connect to the other containers.</p>
<p>The containers are set up so that you can easily ssh between the containers by just entering <code>ssh &lt;hostname&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker exec -it nws-outer1 /bin/bash
root@outer1:/# ssh inner
...
root@inner:~# hostname
inner
root@inner:~# ssh firewall
...
root@firewall:~# hostname
firewall
root@firewall:~# exit
Connection to firewall closed.
root@inner:~# exit
Connection to inner closed.
root@outer1:/# exit
$</code></pre>
<p>A lot more output was displayed in the actual run, but that was removed in what was shown above, and replaced with <code>...</code>.</p>
<h4 id='connecting-to-metasploit'>Connecting to <code>metasploit</code></h4>
<p>If you connect to the <code>metasploit</code> container, you will notice that it asks for a password:</p>
<pre><code>root@outer1:/# ssh metasploit
root@metasploit's password: 
...
root@metasploit:~# hostname
metasploit
root@metasploit:~# logout
Connection to metasploit closed.
root@outer1:/# </code></pre>
<p>The password is just <code>password</code>. This will log you in as <code>root</code>; you can also log into that container with <code>msfadmin</code> and password <code>msfadmin</code>.</p>
<p>The containers <em>other</em> than metasploit are configured to not require public key authentication (see <a href='https://dev.to/gvelrajan/how-to-configure-and-setup-ssh-certificates-for-ssh-authentication-b52'>here</a> if you want to set this up on your own machine). But the metasploit container is such an old version of ssh that it cannot deal with the more recent types of public keys that the ssh currently uses.</p>
<h4 id='more-typical-ssh-usage'>More typical ssh usage</h4>
<p>Normally, you would have to enter the username and the full hostname as well, such as <code>ssh mst3k@portal.cs.virginia.edu</code>. On the course docker configuration, all the hostnames are already defined (see them via <code>more /etc/hosts</code>). If you do not specify a username, it assumes the same username that you are using. When you connect via <code>docker exec</code>, you are the <code>root</code> user, so it assumes you want to connect to those hosts as the <code>root</code> user as well.</p>
<h4 id='sshing-into-the-containers'>ssh’ing <em>into</em> the containers</h4>
<p>In addition to connecting to a container via <code>docker exec</code>, we can also ssh <em>into</em> the containers. If you run <code>docker ps -a</code>, you will see this (among other running containers):</p>
<pre><code>CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                  NAMES
6c553bc3a1af   nws           "/bin/sh -c '/nws-ex…"   16 hours ago   Up 16 hours   0.0.0.0:2222-&gt;22/tcp   nws-firewall</code></pre>
<p>This is saying that port 2222 on you local computer is being redirected to port 22 in the nws-firewall container. Port 22 is the default ssh connection port. You can thus ssh <em>into</em> the firewall container via <code>ssh -p 2222 root@0.0.0.0</code>. Note that in that command we are specifying the port (22) and the IP address listed in the <code>docker ps -a</code> output (here, <code>0.0.0.0</code>, but that may vary for your host). The IP address listed – here <code>0.0.0.0</code>, but might be listed on your machine as a <code>127.0.0.1/24</code> address – means that one can only connect from localhost (i.e., your host machine) and not from an external machine.</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -p 2222 root@0.0.0.0          
The authenticity of host '[0.0.0.0]:2222 ([0.0.0.0]:2222)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:XnnbHbdWKbeL8o85dOT8Ziamt1BZ+6geS1AfD0ptYU0.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[0.0.0.0]:2222' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
root@0.0.0.0's password: 
...
root@firewall:~# 
logout
Connection to 0.0.0.0 closed.
$</code></pre>
<p>The first time you connect to a host, if it does not know the public key of that machine, it will prompt you as it did above. The host key is created when you build the docker containers, and the Dockerfile is set up so that all the containers have the same public key. Thus, if you re-build the containers, the nws-firewall container will have a different key, and it will not match what was saved in your computer. In this case, you will see something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ED25519 key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:XnnbHbdWKbeL8o85dOT8Ziamt1BZ+6geS1AfD0ptYU0.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /Users/mst3k/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /Users/mst3k/.ssh/known_hosts:42
Host key for [0.0.0.0]:2222 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.</code></pre>
<p>We are going to go over ssh man-in-the-middle attacks later in the semester. For now, to fix this, you will need to remove the specified line (42, in this case) and run the ssh command again.</p>
<p>In actual usage, meaning when not trying to connect to your Docker container but to an actual network host, you should take that type of warning <strong><em>VERY</em></strong> seriously.</p>
<h4 id='telnet'><code>telnet</code></h4>
<p>Telnet works in a similar fashion, but does not use encryption. You should NEVER use this in practice; we will only use it in the context of some exploits. The format is <code>telnet &lt;host&gt; [&lt;port&gt;]</code>, where the <code>&lt;port&gt;</code> is optional.</p>
</div><div id='tnmap' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='nmap'>nmap</h3>
<p><code>nmap</code>, which stands for “network mapper”, is a program to see what ports are open on a given machine. In it’s basic usage, it will scan the commonly used ports:</p>
<pre><code>$ nmap scanme.nmap.org
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-16 12:13 EST
Nmap scan report for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)

31337/tcp open     Elite

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.57 seconds
$ </code></pre>
<p>Each port will list it’s <em>state</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>open means the port is available for connections, presumably of the service listed in the 3rd column</li>
<li>filtered means that nmap is not getting a response back, so packets to that port are being dropped</li>
<li>closed (not shown above) means there is no response on that port</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many options that you can supply to nmap; here are a few important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-p &lt;ports&gt;</code>: allows you to narrow down, or expand, the ports that are scanned. For example <code>-p 6200</code> will scan only port 6200, and <code>-p 100-200</code> will only scan those ports; you can also specify an individual port (<code>-p 22</code>), a range of ports (<code>-p 20-30</code>), or a comma-separated list of the above (<code>-p 22,24,26-30</code>).</li>
<li><code>-sV</code> will attempt to determine the versions of the services running on each port</li>
<li><code>-A</code> enables operating system detection</li>
</ul>
<p>Below shows another run of nmap, with the additional information that the above flags provide.</p>

<p>Note that some nmap scans can take quite some time to run, especially as you add more options. Be patient, or specify a smaller port range, as the default is to scan about 1,000 well-known ports.</p>
<p>We can also run nmap on the <code>metasploit</code> container, as shown below. You don’t need to read through all of the output below, just know that you can get a lot of information about the services running on the metasploit container via this command. For example, the 6th line in the output below states, <code>21/tcp   open  ftp         vsftpd 2.3.4</code> – this is the vulnerable vsFTPd version that was exploited in the <a href='../docker/index.html'>Docker configuration assignment</a> (<a href='../docker/index.md'>md</a>).</p>

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 29.506/29.538/29.557/0.020 ms
$</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-c 4</code> tells <code>ping</code> to only try ping’ing 4 times; if this is omitted, it will continue ping’ing, once per second, until you Ctrl-C to exit the program.</p>
<p>Not all hosts will respond to a <code>ping</code>, however, even when they are up. For example, if you are outside of UVA’s networks, then <code>ping -c 4 portal.cs.virginia.edu</code> will not work:</p>
<pre><code>$ ping -c 4 portal.cs.virginia.edu
PING portal (128.143.69.112) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- portal ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3069ms

$</code></pre>
<p>However, <code>nmap -Pn</code> will show that <code>portal.cs.virginia.edu</code> is up and has a few services open, as shown above.</p>
<p>Lastly, note that <code>ping</code> will perform a quick DNS lookup to convert a hostname into an IP address.</p>
</div><div id='tnslookup-and-dig' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='nslookup-and-dig'>nslookup and dig</h3>
<p>Both <code>nslookup</code> (“name service lookup”) and <code>dig</code> (“domain information groper”) perform a DNS lookup – returning, say, an IP address (or multiple IP addresses) for a given hostname. The difference between them is that <code>dig</code> uses the resolver libraries in the operating system, whereas <code>nslookup</code> has it’s own internal resolvers. In general, their results should be the same.</p>
<h4 id='nslookup'><code>nslookup</code></h4>
<p><code>nslookup</code> will look up an IP address and convert it to an hostname. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ nslookup 128.143.33.144
144.33.143.128.in-addr.arpa     name = vadc5.virginia.edu.

Authoritative answers can be found from:

$</code></pre>
<p>The 128.143.33.144 address has the hostname of vadc5.virginia.edu. Note <code>ping virginia.edu</code> will return that same IP address – this is typical for both host redirects and load balancers.</p>
<p>You can also run <code>nslookup</code> on a hostname as well:</p>
<pre><code>$ nslookup virginia.edu
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   virginia.edu
Address: 128.143.33.150
Name:   virginia.edu
Address: 128.143.33.144
Name:   virginia.edu
Address: 54.197.224.147
Name:   virginia.edu
Address: 128.143.33.137
</code></pre>
<p>This shows that the virginia.edu domain is redirecting to those IP addresses, likely for load balancing issues.</p>
<p>Not all IP addresses can be looked up this way, though:</p>
<pre><code>$ nslookup 1.2.3.4
** server can't find 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa: NXDOMAIN

$</code></pre>
<h4 id='dig'><code>dig</code></h4>
<p>The <code>dig</code> command performs a slightly different type of DNS lookup:</p>

</div><div id='tnetcat' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='netcat'>netcat</h3>
<p><code>nc</code>, also known as <code>netcat</code> (both are the same command), is a all-purpose command to send and receive TCP and UDP packets. You saw this command in the <a href='../docker/index.html'>Docker configuration assignment</a> (<a href='../docker/index.md'>md</a>) – it was used to connect to the open port 6200 in the vsFTPd exploit. Note that the <code>ncat</code> command is similar in concept to <code>nc</code>, but a different implementation – we’ll only be going over <code>nc</code>/<code>netcat</code> here.</p>
<p>Netcat is a Swiss army knife of network utilities. It can do most things that the previous commands can do. However, the previous commands have some options that netcat doesn’t have, and are often much easier to use.</p>
<h4 id='connect-to-a-web-server'>Connect to a web server</h4>

<p>While we successfully connected, we entered <code>help</code>, and that is not hart of the http protocol, which is why it responded with “Not Implemented” – the command “help” is not implemented by any web server. Instead, we need to speak http to the webserver – we are going to send it the following (followed by an extra newline):</p>
<pre><code>HEAD / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: curl/7.74.0
Accept: */*</code></pre>
<p>Then our output looks like the following:</p>

<p>Now we are getting better results. However, this is not the easiest way to get a web page, and we can see here how a application specific to the protocol (a web browser) is going to be much easier to use than netcat.</p>

</div><div id='tcurl-and-wget' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='curl-and-wget'>curl and wget</h3>
<h4 id='curl'><code>curl</code></h4>
<p><code>curl</code> is a command-line utility for transferring data via a URI, such as an http:// address. It is useful in scripts and programs, as we avoid having to load up a browser each time.</p>
<p>For example, we can download the UVA logo at the top of <a href='https://www.virginia.edu'>https://www.virginia.edu</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl https://www.virginia.edu/sites/all/themes/custom/uva/images/logo-horizontal-retina.svg -o uva-logo.svg
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

100 16296  100 16296    0     0  75489      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 75795
$</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-o uva-logo.svg</code> tells <code>curl</code> what filename to save the file as; adding <code>-O</code> will save it as the original file name.. The output displayed shows statistics about the download – as this file was so small in size, there isn’t much to display. Add the <code>-s</code> option to have it suppress this output.</p>
<p>We can use other protocols, such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol). In the docker containers:</p>
<pre><code>root@outer1:/# curl -O -u msfadmin:msfadmin ftp://metasploit/vulnerable/tikiwiki/tikiwiki-1.9.4.zip 
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  9.9M  100  9.9M    0     0   102M      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  103M
root@outer1:/# </code></pre>
<p>In a real script, you would NEVER want to include the password, but it’s not really much of a secret for the metasploit container.</p>
<p>There are many other things that <code>curl</code> can do; <a href='https://linuxize.com/post/curl-command-examples/'>here</a> is a list of example usages if you are interested in learning more (not required for this assignment).</p>
<h4 id='wget'><code>wget</code></h4>
<p><code>wget</code> is similar to <code>curl</code> in that it will download a file. Whereas <code>curl</code> can do a whole bunch of protocols, <code>wget</code> is only for http:// and https:// (and a few other related protocols). <code>wget</code> has some more options, such as mirroring a website, changing URLs, etc. For our usages in this course, it will operate just like <code>curl</code>, but is better for web pages.</p>
