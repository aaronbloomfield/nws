## Social Engineering
> the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access
>
> \- Wikipedia



## Why social engineering works
- Posing as a trusted brand
- Posing as a government agency or authority figure
- Inducing fear or a sense of urgency
- Appealing to greed
- Appealing to helpfulness or curiosity
- Emotional manipulation

<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea data-template>
## Exploiting password re-use
- If one system is compromised, and the passwords revealed
- Then they may be the same passwords elsewhere



## How Hacking Works ([xkcd 2176](https://xkcd.com/2176/))

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/how_hacking_works.png" title="If only somebody had warned them that the world would roll them like this." alt="How Hacking Works" srcset="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/how_hacking_works_2x.png 2x" style="image-orientation:none" class='stretch'>



## Phishing
- A digital (or voice) message to get the victim to do something
  - Install software, reveal sensitive information, transferring money or assets, etc.
- Messages (generally) look like they are coming from a reputable source
  - With generative AI, these are becoming much harder to spot!



## Phishing types
- Bulk phishing emails: send out a million emails, hope a few click on the link
  - The information is often generic
- Voice phishing (or vishing): done through phone calls
- SMS phishing (or smishing): done through SMS text messages
- Search engine phishing: manipulate a search engine so that a malicious website appears high in the rankings
- Angler phishing: uses fake social media accounts to pose as individuals, companies, etc.
- Spear fishing: next slide

## Spear fishing
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Spear_Fishing_%2815828004706%29.jpg/1024px-Spear_Fishing_%2815828004706%29.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spear_Fishing_(15828004706).jpg)
- Spear phishing: targets a specific individual
  - Perhaps the attackers research this individual
  - Or perhaps they email all faculty in a department's online listing
  - Whale phishing: when the person targetted is a high-profile individual
- A 2021 study:
  -  43% of youth 18-25 and 58% of older users clicked on simulated phishing links in daily emails over 21 days

<h2 class="r-fit-text">Phishing ex: 2015-2016 DNC attack</h2>

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/John_Podesta_February_2024_%281%29.jpg/448px-John_Podesta_February_2024_%281%29.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:John_Podesta_February_2024_(1).jpg)
- March 2016: John Podesta (pictured), chair of Hillary Clinton's campaign, received a (spear-)phishing email
  - Posing as a "Google security alert"
  - He asks IT if it's valid
  - They respond that it's "legitimate"
    - Claimed later that they *meant* to say "illegitimate"
- Podesta gets phished
  - The attackers have his email login info
- Attackers: Russian intelligence via the [Fancy Bear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear)



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
<h2 class="r-fit-text">Phishing ex: 2015-2016 DNC attack</h2>

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Wikileaks_logo.svg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikileaks_logo.svg)
- Emails are leaked to [Wikileaks](https://wikileaks.org) and [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange)
- Who then posts them in the fall of 2016 in the most embarassingly way possible
  - Assange is currently about to be extradited to the US
- This significantly impacted Clinton's popularity
  - And may well have decided the campaign



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800 no-border" -->
## Baiting
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Rapala_lures_1.jpg/1024px-Rapala_lures_1.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rapala_lures_1.jpg)
- Lures people into giving up sensitive information
  - .. or downloading malicious code ...
  - By offering something valuable
- Examples
  - 419 scam
  - Malware-infected games, cryptocurrency miners, etc.
  - Free USB drives lying around



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
## Nigerian Prince (aka 419) Scam
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Location_Nigeria_AU_Africa.svg/500px-Location_Nigeria_AU_Africa.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)
- Aka a 419 scam, as section 419 of the Nigerian criminal code deals with fraud
  - And a majority of these seem to come from Nigeria
- Promises of lots of money if the victim will help financially at first
  - Money transfer costs
  - Prince expatriation costs
- Common elements:
  - Irreversible money transfers
  - Anonymous communication
  - Invitation to visit the country



## Nigerian Prince Scam Stats
- Many people do not report it due to embarrassment, but...
- This used to be *millions* lost per year
  - Some individuals lost millions
  - This was once one of the top grossing industries in Nigeria!
- There have been significant efforts:
  - More awareness
  - Digital filtering
  - Better enforcement in Nigeria
  - Money transfer entities being more aware of this
- But still $700k lost in 2018




<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800 no-border" -->
## Tailgating
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Precision_parking_or_extreme_tailgating%3F.jpg/1024px-Precision_parking_or_extreme_tailgating%3F.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Precision_parking_or_extreme_tailgating%3F.jpg)
- Following a person into a locked area
  - That person opens the door, you also go through
- Digital: when a person leaves his/her computer without logging out
  - Someone can sit down and use it
- UVA example: Rice Hall during football games
  - Somebody has access, and when they leave, other attendees go into the building



## Pretexting
- Attacker creates a fake situation for the victim
  - And then is just the person to solve it, but needs some sensitive information
- Example: security breach!  Send me your account userid and password to fix
- All social engineering scams have some amount of pretexting



## Quid pro quo
- Provide a desired "thing" in exchange for sensitive information
- Examples:
  - Fake contest winnings
  - Loyalty rewards
  - "A gift for your purchase"



## Scareware
- Some type of software...
  - ... either installed or a convincing website ...
  - ... that obtains sensitive information
- Examples
  - Fake law enforcement notice accusing you of a crime
  - Fake tech support message stating malware is on your device



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800 no-border" -->
## Watering hole attack
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Watering_hole_at_Graig_Lwyd_-_geograph.org.uk_-_3010579.jpg/949px-Watering_hole_at_Graig_Lwyd_-_geograph.org.uk_-_3010579.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Watering_hole_at_Graig_Lwyd_-_geograph.org.uk_-_3010579.jpg)
- Attackers inject malicious code into a webpage visited by the victims
  - From the phrase "somebody poisoned the watering hole"
- Can have a lot of payloads: stolen credentials, installing ransomware, etc.

<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea data-template>
<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800 no-border" -->
## 1. Password management
[![](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb2t/nws-img/password-mug.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078QSQSD9)
- Longer passwords are harder to crack
- Passwords with numbers, letters, punctuation are not susceptible to dictionary attacks
- Use different passwords for each site
  - Likely managed with a password manager



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
## 2. Multi-factor identification
[![](https://images.g2crowd.com/uploads/product/image/large_detail/large_detail_445b18a93ca42b2e20710d8fd8646a00/cisco-duo.png)](https://duo.com)
- Requiring a second means of authentication means a compromised password will not allow access to the system
- UVA uses Duo, of course
- Other sites use SMS text messages
  - Insecure!  Some celluar providers are inserting messages into these texts
- aka Two Factor Authentication, aka 2FA



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-1000" -->
## 2FA: A UVA hack (2016)
[![](images/social-eng/uva-phishing-hack.webp)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/01/22/phishing-hack-at-the-university-of-virginia-compromises-employee-computer-records/)
- About 1k employee's records were accessed, including SSNs
- This attack prompted UVA to initiate the multi-factor authentication for everybody



## 2FA: DUO Exhaustion Attack
- If the attackers have your password
  - Then they can try to log in.  Often.  Forever.
  - Eventually you get "exhausted" from always hitting deny that you then hit "approve" to silence it
- This happened at UVA a year (or so) ago
  - [UVA ITS: What is Duo Fatigue? Why is It Dangerous?](https://security.virginia.edu/what-is-duo-fatigue)
- Many 2FA providers now lock accounts that are getting too many denied requests



## 2FA: Bypassing
- Password reset
  - Often 2FA is not implemented in the password reset page
- Using OAuth, which acts as the second authentication factor
- Brute force: if it's a code, just keep trying
- Use pre-generated keys
- They set up 2FA before you do



## 2FA: Bypassing
- Create a fake impersonation website, and get someone to connect to it via a phishing scam
- When they try to log in, ask for their 2FA
- The site is also trying to log into the *real* version
- When the user provides their 2FA, the fake site uses it to log into the real site
  - 2FA bypassed!
- The fake site can provide the content of the real site
  - The user may be none the wiser



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800 no-border" -->
<h2 class="r-fit-text">3. Email with anti-phishing defenses</h2>

![](images/social-eng/outlook-phishing-protection.webp)
- Many (most? all?) email clients have this
- Advantage: it can prevent phishing attacks for all users
- Disadvantage: you can't see the link when you hover over it
- Disadvantage: this can be over-relied upon, and they may not be able to update their database quickly for new attacks



## 4. Security awareness training
- Even for the technically savvy!
- But especially for the non-technical users



## 5. Knowing the warning signs
- Strange messages
- Most bad English
- Urgent requests
- Emotional manipulation
- Invokes fear or panic
- Feels too good to be true
- Unsolicited help
- False or unproven identity
