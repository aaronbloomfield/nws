# Miscellaneous Topics
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Set UID bit
- One can have a program run as the owner, rather than the user running it
- Done via the Set UID bit
  - `chmod 4755 <file>`
- If that file is *root*, then it's a potential security hole
  - Many UNIX systems prevent changing of the executable in memory that has this bit set



## Privilege Escalation
- Obtaining "more" privileges than the user already has
  - Perhaps super-user, etc.
- Done via some type of security flaw
  - Bad passwords, buffer overflow, other vulnerability, etc.
- Types:
  - Vertical: become a more "powerful" user
  - Horizontal: gain privileges of another user of the same "level"



## Windows Authentication

<img src="images/graphs/winauth.dot.webp" class="stretch">



## Pass the Hash
- If one can gain access to a Windows system
  - And if they can gain a password hash
    - Perhaps by viewing it on the network
- They can move throughout the network, using the hash as the authentication mechanism
- They don't need to know the password!
- Attack targets:
  - Attacking services: DNS, LDAP, etc.
  - Exfiltrating data 



## Kerberos
- Handles both authentication and authorization
- Normal authentication method:
  - User enters password, which is hashed
  - Hashed password is sent over the network
  - It's compared to what's in the DB to check if it matches
- Kerberos hashes the password, but:
  - Doesn't send it over the network
  - Uses it as the encryption & decryption key



[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Kerberos_protocol.svg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kerberos_protocol.svg)



## Kerberos Usage
- Default on Windows when both client & server are part of the same domain
  - The same *trusted* domain
- Runs on UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS also
- If either is not, or if the domain is not trusted, then it defaults to sending a password hash
- Problem: a single trusted server is needed
  - And that server is the target of many attacks



## Password cracking
- Using GPUs: an nVidia 4090 (about $2k)
  - 8 character password: 6.5 hours
- This can be sped up if you assume "standard" password formation rules
- The next slide has a table of password cracking times
  - But I think it's off by one row

# Course Reflection
    </textarea></section>

    <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Course Goals
- Understand network models, both OSI and TCP/IP
- Understand how to analyze network traffic and how to scan for malware therein 
- Understand the details of common network attacks, as well as their defenses (ARP, DOSes, etc.)
- Understand the common network services that help to secure a network (DNSSEC, VPNs, PGP, firewalls, etc.)
- Understand the role and use of cryptography in network security (AES, RSA, DHE, TLS, etc.)
- Be able to secure a network from outside attacks

## Topics we didn't cover
- We pretty much covered everything I intended us to cover



## What didn't work well
- A few of the homeworks were a bit rough
  - ARP, in particular
- Docker suddenly stopping working half-way through the semester
- Delays getting out the homeworks
- My slowness in regrading
- Support request response slowness



## What did work well
- The lecture topics; all the intended material was covered
- The homeworks, for the most part
- The combination of smaller and larger homeworks
- The Docker containers (when they worked right)



## Did I push too hard?
- I feel that the frustration was more caused by other issues than the raw work load:
  - Problems debugging some network issues
  - Problems with some homework specifications
- Factoring that out, was it too hard?



## Changes for next time
- I don't have to create everything from scratch!
- A few more homeworks
  - I still want to do a DNS homework
- Docker configuration updates
- More CTFs, perhaps



## Let me know your comments!
- Please send us your feedback!
  - Either by e-mail or anonymously or on the course surveys
- Please fill out the course surveys!



<h2>Have a great break!</h2>
